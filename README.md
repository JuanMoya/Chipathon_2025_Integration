# IEEE SSCS Chipathon2025: Integration Track Documentation 
This repository contains the primary documentation related to the Integration track for the [IEEE SSCS Chipathon 2025](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-chipathon-2025/)

The design manual of the GlobalFoundries GF180MCU PDK can be found [here](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/Design_Manual.html#design-manual).

The padring provided for this Chipathon was generated by Mehdi Saligane's research group. The GF180mcu padring can be found [here](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc-tapeouts/tree/main/gf180mcu_padframe).  The available design area for participants is 2040um x 2040um and there 88 pins total (22 pins in each side). For the 2023 Chipathon version, we used a QFN-88 package reference.

The [process](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_02.html) used for this Chipathon is defined as:
| Process | Operating Voltages |
| 0.18um 3.3V/(5V) 6V (with MIM) | LV=3.3V, HV=5V or 6V |

Regarding the MIM caps there are 2 options as defined [here](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_02.html)

- MIM option A is between 3 and 2 and option B is TM/TM-1

More information about the layout layers can be found [here](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_04_1.html) and the topological truth table for 3.3V(5V)6V Process can be [here](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_04_4.html).

Below is an image of the layout pattern and the different cells that compose it.

It's important to note that the pin distribution will change based on the integrated projects, as demonstrated by the three projects submitted for the 2023 Chipathon. Here are the repositories of the project submitted.

- [LTC1](https://github.com/Azeem-Abbas/DC23-LTC1/tree/main)
- [LTC2](https://github.com/akiles-esta-usado/DC23-LTC2/tree/f6358b6aff1b4526a014195b640335f1def6f0c5/padframe)
- [LTC3 - Bracolin](https://github.com/gabrielmaranhao/Bracolin/tree/main)

## Example of Pin cells connection

Follows a description of the main pin cells used in Bracolin and some examples for pin connection.

Configuration for each of the pin cells provided for GlobalFoundries GF180MCU PDK are [here](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/IPs/IO/gf180mcu_fd_io/functional.html). All the I/O cells include ESD protections.

Some of the main cells included in Bracolin are:
- gf180mcu_fd_io__dvdd
- gf180mcu_fd_io__dvss
- gf180mcu_fd_io__asig_5p0 (analog inputs)
- gf180mcu_fd_io__bi_t (digital outputs)

Below is the layout connection for the VDD pin (gf180mcu_fd_io__dvdd).

### Detailed connection for Digital output pin configuration
First, we need to configure the control pins, as indicated in the [GlobalFoundries GF180MCU PDK documentation](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/IPs/IO/gf180mcu_fd_io/digital.html).

Based on the documentation, the output pin connection is shown below:
<p align="center">
   <img src="./img/digital_pin_connection_2.png" width="600" />
</p> 

Then, we need to configure the driver function, as illustrated in the Tri-state Programmable Digital I/O Cell [documentation](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/IPs/IO/gf180mcu_fd_io/digital.html), as indicated below:

The input driver is disabled. A is the output coming from the circuit designed.

</p> 

### Detailed connection of the signal rails
VDD ('1') and VSS ('0') signals are generated by using the `gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu7t5v0_tieh` and `gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu7t5v0_filltie` cells, as indicated below.

### Custom ESD cell for Low-Current applications
Some of the building blocks in the Bracolin die lacked ESD protection due to leakage. The leakage current of the ESD protection was too high for the design. PEX Simulations in Magic and commercial tool demonstrated that the value of the leaking current was approximately 200pA.

### Additional information about final DRC verification
During the final DRC verification of the 3 projects, new DRC rules appeared when running DRC flow with the gf180 commercial PDK. Especially for circuits close to the I/O pads. This issue was also identified in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12w4WBoleFAE4UePdoUf-bxsZR_BttwY3wknBPPJrEHE/edit?slide=id.g2318c480afb_0_0#slide=id.g2318c480afb_0_0) provided by Mehdi’s research group (slides 13 and 14).

Here is a list of the DRC errors that we could waive after checking with the foundry:
